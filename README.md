# Materials-Cost-Calculator-With-GUI
This desktop app calculates the total materials cost, including tax, of your construction/renovation project. The app is unit agnostic so that you can use any units you'd like. Note: If you're only looking to find the total cost of a two dimensional project, then either leave the `Height` field blank or input a `0` into it. The concept for this program is based off of my Materials Cost Calculator script that can only be ran in the terminal (https://github.com/TechProofreader/Materials-Cost-Calculator). The difference here is that I rewrote the code entirely to include a graphical user interface (GUI) and simplified the logic of the overall program. This program can be turned into a standalone program on various platforms such as Mac OS, Windows OS, and Linux.

[This is what the the program looks like when in use.](MaterialsCostCalcMainScreen.png)
