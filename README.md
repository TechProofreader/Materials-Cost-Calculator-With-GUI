# Materials-Cost-Calculator-With-GUI

_Note: This is a Beginner Level program that you can use to further your Python knowledge by first learning how the base program works, and then extending the program with your own additions._

This desktop app calculates the total materials cost, including tax, of your 2D construction/renovation project. The app is unit agnostic so that you can use any units you'd like. Note: If you'd like to calculate the total materials cost minus tax, just input `0` into the `Sales Tax` input field. The concept for this program is based off of my Materials Cost Calculator script that can only be ran in the terminal (https://github.com/TechProofreader/Materials-Cost-Calculator). The difference here is that I rewrote the code entirely to include a graphical user interface (GUI) and simplified the logic of the overall program.

This software can be turned into a standalone program on various platforms such as Mac OS, Windows OS, and Linux via freezing the script itself by way of packages such as [py2app](https://pypi.org/project/py2app/), [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/), etc.
