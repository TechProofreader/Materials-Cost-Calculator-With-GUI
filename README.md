# Materials-Cost-Calculator-With-GUI
This app calculates the total materials cost of your 2D construction/renovation project, including tax. The concept for this program is based off of my Materials Cost Calculator script that can only be ran in the terminal (https://github.com/TechProofreader/Materials-Cost-Calculator). The difference here is that I rewrote the code entirely to include a graphical user interface (GUI) and simplified the logic of the overall program. This program can be turned into a standalone program on various platforms such as Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.
